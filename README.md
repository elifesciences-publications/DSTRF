# DSTRF
Dynamic Spectrotemporal Receptive Field Analysis, per ["Estimating and interpreting nonlinear receptive field of sensory neural responses with deep neural network models"](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53445).

Matlab and python functions and scripts are under their correponding directories. To get started, take a look at the jupyter notebook under the python directory.

### TODO
1. Add data jackknifing procedure for roust analysis.
2. Port network nonlinearity calculations from Matlab to Python for better integration.
3. Organize code into a more accessible interface.
